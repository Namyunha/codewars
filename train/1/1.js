// The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).
// The next words should be always capitalized.

// Examples
// "the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"

// "The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"

// "The_Stealth-Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
